### 1. Loading and preprocessing the data

The first step was to read the file **activity.zip** and to save it in the object *dados*. The ZIP file must be placed in the same folder of this Markdown document in order to run the embedded code. The variable **date** was converted to a *date* class.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("activity.csv")) {
        unzip("activity.zip")
}
dados <- read.csv("repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2", header = TRUE, na.strings = "NA")
str(dados)

```
  
### 2. What is mean total number of steps taken per day?  

The code below created a factor variable named **dia** that was used to split the dataset.
